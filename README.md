# Network Analysis

This project performs network analysis on a social network dataset using Python, NetworkX, and Matplotlib. The dataset is analyzed to compute key metrics such as node degrees, centrality measures, and connected components. The results are visualized as a graph.

## **Project Overview**
- **Dataset**: The dataset is a social network graph in edge list format, where each row represents a connection between two nodes.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `NetworkX`: For creating and analyzing the graph.
  - `Matplotlib`: For visualizing the graph.
  - `Pandas`: For loading and processing the dataset.
- **Output**:
  - Metrics like node degrees, connected components, and centrality measures.
  - A visualization of the network graph.
